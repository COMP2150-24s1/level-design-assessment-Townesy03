## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

I designed the first section (everything before the hub room) to only have one mechanic introduced per encounter, helping the player slowly learn mechanics and not overwhelm them. After this a introduce enemies in the grassy cave (section 2), and finally puzzle mechanics, switches and boxes in the puzzle chamber (section 3). I also broke up the introduction of the staff and the gun to give the player time to get used to combat and enemies before giving them another weapon as well as to keep a level of difficulty in the grassy cave.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

I intentionally seperated the three sections with either one way drops, the hub or long hallways as spots of rest for the player and giving them time to slow down and recover. In the first section the difficulty of encounters slowly increases then the player gets dropped into the hub room revealing the main goal. They then enter the grassy cave and the difficulty in platforming and enemies slowly increases. there is a short one way drop halfway through this section, before giving them a more intense platforming and emeny encounter, as well as introducing the gun to again give them a moment of rest before introducing a large mechanic. the final section is more of a puzzle room with a scavenger hunt, so I gave a few spots where there are no enemies as well spaces for the player to see what they are looking for to give them time to think. I also loop the first section back to the hub to remind the player of their main goal.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

I have made the first section not challenging and very linear to clearly guide the player first and get them into a flow. After dropping them into the hub I have designed each section to ensure the player can always be doing something, and keeping them engaged by throwing varied mechanics at them as well as balancing the rooms to not have too many enemies that player feels overwhelmed. The puzzle room has two different puzzles, a scaveneger hunt and a box moving puzzle. I used the single use switches to give a visual indicator that the player is progressing as they stay on when they are hit. The box moving puzzle I designed to show the player when things happen, e.g. the box drops in view when the switch is hit and shows the door opening that the player needs to open to drop the box further down the map.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

Section 1 is not designed for exploration but for teaching, whereas sections 2 and 3 are designed for exploration. In section 2, I used a door to lock the progession until the player searches around and finds the switch, I added a hidden cove and an upper platform out of view from the player to give areas for the player to explore and find, as well as making the section very apone allowing the player to easily move around and search. In section 3 I added a scavenger hunt with switches hidden across the area that they have to shoot to again give a sense of exploration for the player. I also decided to give the three sections distinctly different designs, Section 2 has a more natural cave like design, section 3 had a more labrynth alien ruin design as well, and section 1 is a more above ground glade that blends into the ruin asthetic at the end.

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)

During my process I did end up finding that the first section of the level felt too complicated and so I split the moving platforms and spike pits into two seperate sections. I did also initially give the gun and staff in the first section but later decided to move the gun to the ruin under the grassy cave. Additionally this change was made when I also felt the long tunnel under section 2 was far too long and decided to add in a section of platforming and enemies to give the section a better drama curve and better pacing. The puzzle design in section three was also changed, most notably the scavanger hunt was added, changing the acid pit to be moved and adding in three switches rather than just one to add to the difficulty and exploration. I did also have to change the entrance to the key room as the player was initally able to jump into the key room after solving one of the puzzles beating out the animation time, so i added the surrounding shell to force the player to take more time to reach the doors.

I would, if I would continue to develop this is to add in more aesthetic changes and additions to the overall level to make the exploration more enjoyable. I would continue to decorate the entire level in a similar way to the starting area and make the whole level look more like a jungle in the grassy cave and more like an alien ruin in the puzzle chamber.
